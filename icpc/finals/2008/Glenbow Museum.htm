The famous Glenbow Museum in Calgary is Western Canada's largest
museum, with exhibits ranging from art to cultural history to
mineralogy. A brand new section is being planned, devoted to brilliant
computer programmers just like you. Unfortunately, due to lack of
space, the museum is going to have to build a brand new building and
relocate into it. </p><p>
The size and capacity of the new building differ from those of the
original building. But the floor plans of both buildings are orthogonal
polygons. An orthogonal polygon is a polygon whose internal angles are
either 90째 or 270째. If 90째 angles are denoted as R (Right) and 270째
angles are denoted as O (Obtuse) then a string containing only R and O
can roughly describe an orthogonal polygon. For example, a rectangle
(Figure 1) is the simplest orthogonal polygon and it can be described
as RRRR (the angles are listed in counter-clockwise order, starting
from any corner). Similarly, a cross-shaped orthogonal polygon (Figure
2) can be described by the sequence RRORRORRORRO, RORRORRORROR, or
ORRORRORRORR. These sequences are called <span class="textit">angle strings</span>.

<p>
Of course, an angle string does not completely specify the shape of a
polygon -- it says nothing about the length of the sides. And some
angle strings cannot possibly describe a valid orthogonal polygon
(RRROR, for example). </p><p>
To complicate things further, not all orthogonal polygons are
acceptable floor plans for the museum. A museum contains many valuable
objects, and these objects must be guarded. Due to cost considerations,
no floor can have more than one guard. So a floor plan is acceptable
only if there is a place within the floor from which one guard can see
the entire floor. Similarly, an angle string is acceptable only if it
describes at least one acceptable polygon. Note that the cross-shaped
polygon in Figure 2 can be guarded by someone standing in the center,
so it is acceptable. Thus the angle string RRORRORRORRO is acceptable,
even though it also describes other polygons that cannot be properly
guarded by a single guard. </p><p>
Help the designers of the new building determine how many acceptable angle strings there are of a given length.
