A seaport container terminal stores large containers that are
eventually loaded on seagoing ships for transport abroad. Containers
coming to the terminal by road and rail are stacked at the terminal as
they arrive. </p><p>
Seagoing ships carry large numbers of containers. The time to load a
ship depends in part on the locations of its containers. The loading
time increases when the containers are not on the top of the stacks,
but can be fetched only after removing other containers that are on top
of them. </p><p>
The container terminal needs a plan for stacking containers in order to
decrease loading time. The plan must allow each ship to be loaded by
accessing only topmost containers on the stacks, and minimizing the
total number of stacks needed. </p><p>
For this problem, we know the order in which ships must be loaded and
the order in which containers arrive. Each ship is represented by a
capital letter between A and Z (inclusive), and the ships will be
loaded in alphabetical order. Each container is labeled with a capital
letter representing the ship onto which it needs to be loaded. There is
no limit on the number of containers that can be placed in a single
stack.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>The input file contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists
of a single line containing from 1 to 1000 capital letters representing
the order of arrival of a set of containers. For example, the line ABAC
means consecutive containers arrive to be loaded onto ships A, B, A,
and C, respectively. When all containers have arrived, the ships are
loaded in strictly increasing order: first ship A, then ship B, and so
on. </p><p>
A line containing the word <tt>end</tt> follows the last test case.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each input case, print the case number (beginning with 1) and the
minimum number of stacks needed to store the containers before loading
starts. Your output format should be similar to the one shown here.
