<P>Your job is to write a program that plans airplane flights. Each flight 
consists of a series of one or more legs. Your program must choose the best 
altitude for each leg to minimize the amount of fuel consumption during the 
trip. 
<P>
<P><BR>The airplane has a fixed airspeed, given by the constant VCRUISE, and a 
most-efficient cruising altitude, AOPT. When flying at altitude AOPT, fuel 
consumption in gallons per hour is given by GPHOPT. When flying at an altitude 
that is different from AOPT, fuel consumption increases by GPHEXTRA for each 
1000 feet above or below AOPT. The flight starts and finishes at an altitude of 
0. Each 1000 foot climb burns an extra amount of fuel given by CLIMBCOST (there 
is no reduction in fuel consumption when you descend). Make the approximation 
that all climbing and descending is done in zero time at the beginning of each 
flight leg. Thus each leg is flown at a constant airspeed and altitude. For this 
problem, the airplane characteristics are given by the following constants:

<P><BR>Before each flight, you are given the length of each leg and the tailwind 
expected for each leg. A positive tailwind increases the airplane's speed over 
the ground, and a negative tailwind decreases its speed over the ground. For 
example, if airspeed is 400 knots and the tailwind is -50 knots, speed over the 
ground is 350 knots. 
<P>By policy, altitude for each leg must be some integer multiple of 1000 feet, 
between 20,000 and 40,000 feet, inclusive. Your program must compute the best 
altitude for each leg to minimize overall fuel consumption for the trip, and 
must compute the fuel required for the trip.

<H2><FONT color=#0070e8><A 
name=SECTION0001001000000000000000>Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT> </H2>The first line 
contains an integer <SPAN class=MATH><I>N</I></SPAN>, representing the number of 
flights you are required to plan. Each flight consists of the following input 
lines: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>The first input line in a flight contains an integer <SPAN 
  class=MATH><I>K</I></SPAN> (<!-- MATH
 $0 < K < 10$
 --> <SPAN class=MATH>0 
  &lt; <I>K</I> &#8804; 100</SPAN>), representing the number of legs in the flight. 
  <LI>The next <SPAN class=MATH><I>K</I></SPAN> input lines each contain the 
  following three integers: 
  <OL>
    <LI>The length of the leg, in nautical miles 
    <LI>The expected tailwind at 20,000 feet, in knots 
    <LI>The expected tailwind at 40,000 feet, in knots </LI></OL></LI></UL>
<P>The expected tailwind at altitudes between 20,000 and 40,000 feet is computed 
by linear interpolation. For example, the expected tailwind at 30,000 feet is 
halfway between the expected tailwind at 20,000 feet and the expected tailwind 
at 40,000 feet.

<H2><FONT color=#0070e8><A 
name=SECTION0001002000000000000000>Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT> </H2>Your program 
must produce one output line for each flight. The output line must contain the 
flight number (counting from the beginning of the problem), the chosen altitude 
for each leg (in thousands of feet), and the fuel required for the trip (in 
gallons, to the upper gallon). If several solutions exist, choose the one with 
the lower altitude in the earlier legs of the flight.
