<P>How to make gold from lead has baffled alchemists for centuries. At the last 
Alchemists Club Meeting (ACM), a sensational breakthrough was announced. By 
mixing the three chemicals Algolene, Basicine and Cobolase in the correct ratio, 
one can create a mixture that transforms lead into gold. Since Algolene, 
Basicine and Cobolase (or A, B, C for short) are generally not sold 
individually, but rather mixed into solutions, this may not be easy as it seems. 

<P>Consider the following example. Two mixtures of Algolene, Basicine and 
Cobolase are available, in weights 1:2:3 and 3:7:1, respectively. By mixing 
these solutions in a ratio of 1:2 we obtain a solution of A, B, C with weights 
7:16:5. But there is no way to combine these mixtures into a new one with 
weights 3:4:5. If we additionally had a solution of weights 2:1:2, then a 3:4:5 
mixture would be possible by combining eight parts of 1:2:3, one part of 3:7:1 
and five parts of 2:1:2. As you see in both examples, weights for each component 
must be integers. 
<P>Determining which mixing weights we can obtain from a given set of solutions 
is no trivial task. But, as the ACM has shown, it is possibly a very profitable 
one. You must write a program to find mixing ratios.

for each mixture, and none of them will be greater than 15000. 
<P>Finally, there is one line containing three non-negative integers <SPAN

class=MATH><I>a</I> : <I>b</I> : <I>c</I></SPAN> in the desired solution. At 
least one of these integers is not 0. 
<P>The input file is terminated with the integer `<TT>0</TT>' on a line by 
itself following the last test case.
