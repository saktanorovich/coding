The Apartment Construction Management (ACM) has several new high-rise apartment buildings in suburban 
Shanghai. With the booming economy, ACM expects a considerable profit on apartment leases. Because their 
apartments receive more direct sunlight, the company claims that these are nicer than others in the area. No other 
buildings obstruct the sunlight path to apartments in ACM's tall buildings. 

</p><p>

</p><p>
<br>
ACM wants to verify this claim by telling potential residents exactly how much sunlight a given apartment receives.
To offer customers a representative sample of sunlight hours, the company wants to advertise the sunlight hours for 
April 6, 2005. On that day in Shanghai, the sun rises at 5:37 am, and sets at 6:17 pm.

<p>
As shown above, apartments are in a series of buildings aligned east to west. The last two digits of the apartment
number identify the building, starting with 01 for the east-most building. The other digits encode the apartment floor,
with 1 as the ground floor.

</p><p>

</p><p>
<br>
The sun rises in the east and travels at a constant radial speed across the sky, until setting in the west. The only
shadows are created by buildings (i.e. each building can cast a shadow on one or more other buildings). An
apartment is considered to receive sunlight when either its eastern or western exterior wall is fully covered in
sunlight or when the sun is directly overhead.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The input file contains a series of descriptions of apartment complexes. Each description starts with a line containing
a single integer <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> <!-- MATH
 $(1 \le n < 100)$
 -->
<span class="MATH">(1<img src="Lots%20of%20Sunlight_files/3273img2.png" alt="$ \le$" align="middle" border="0" height="30" width="18"><i>n</i> &lt; 100)</span> that is the number of apartment buildings in the complex. The next line has two
integers <span class="MATH"><i>w</i></span>, the width (in east-west direction), and <span class="MATH"><i>h</i></span>, each apartment's height in meters. Next is a list of integers
<span class="MATH"><i>m</i>(1)</span>, <span class="MATH"><i>d</i> (1)</span>, <span class="MATH"><i>m</i>(2)</span>, <span class="MATH"><i>d</i> (2)</span>, <span class="MATH">...</span>, <span class="MATH"><i>d</i> (<i>n</i> - 1)</span>, <span class="MATH"><i>m</i>(<i>n</i>)</span>, where <span class="MATH"><i>m</i>(<i>i</i>)</span> is the number of apartments in apartment building
<span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>, and <span class="MATH"><i>d</i> (<i>i</i>)</span> is the distance, in meters, between the apartment building <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span> and apartment building <span class="MATH"><i>i</i> + 1</span>.

</p><p>

</p><p>
<br>
The apartment complex description is followed by an integer list of apartments to query for sunlight hours and is
terminated by a zero. The input file is terminated by a line consisting of the integer zero.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each apartment complex description, output its number in the sequence of descriptions. Then for each query,
output the corresponding sunlight hours, using the 24-hour time format. Truncate all times down to the nearest
second. If the query refers to an apartment that does not exist, indicate that the apartment does not exist. Follow the
format shown in the sample output.
