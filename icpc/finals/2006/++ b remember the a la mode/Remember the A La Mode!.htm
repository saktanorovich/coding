Hugh Samston owns the ``You Want It, Hugh Got It" catering service,
which has been asked to supply desserts for the participants in this
year's ICPC World Finals. Hugh will provide pie slices topped with ice
cream at the various social functions scheduled throughout the week. As
with any other dedicated entrepreneur, Hugh would like to offer the
best service possible, so he has ordered a wide variety of pies and ice
creams to satisfy even the most eclectic tastes. </p><p>
Hugh plans to serve each pie slice with a single scoop of ice cream,
leaving the exact combination up to the whim of the customer. But of
course, as with any other dedicated entrepreneur, Hugh would also like
to make as much profit as possible from this enterprise. He knows ahead
of time how much profit he can make on each combination of pie slice
and ice cream scoop, as well as which combinations of pie and ice cream
should never be put together (example: Peppermint Banana Chunk ice
cream on Key Lime pie). </p><p>
Given this information, along with the number of slices and scoops he
has of each variety of pie and ice cream, Hugh figures he can determine
both the minimum and maximum profits he can expect. Since he hopes to
be the caterer at subsequent World Finals, he would like a general
program to solve this and future problems.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Input will consist of multiple problem instances. Each problem instance will start with a line containing two integers <span class="MATH"><i>P</i></span> <!-- MATH
 $(P \le 50)$
 -->
<span class="MATH">(<i>P</i><img src="Remember%20the%20A%20La%20Mode%21_files/3562img1.png" alt="$ \le$" align="middle" border="0" height="31" width="18">50)</span> and <span class="MATH"><i>I</i></span> <!-- MATH
 $(I \le 50)$
 -->
<span class="MATH">(<i>I</i><img src="Remember%20the%20A%20La%20Mode%21_files/3562img1.png" alt="$ \le$" align="middle" border="0" height="31" width="18">50)</span>, indicating the number of types of pie and ice cream, respectively. The next line will contain <span class="MATH"><i>P</i></span> integers indicating the number of slices available for each of the pie types. The line after that will contain <span class="MATH"><i>I</i></span>
integers indicating the number of scoops available for each of the ice
cream types. The total number of pie slices will always equal the total
number of ice cream scoops available, and it is assumed that all pie
slices and ice cream scoops will be used. </p><p>
Each problem instance will end with <span class="MATH"><i>P</i></span> lines each containing <span class="MATH"><i>I</i></span>
floating point numbers indicating the profit for each pie/ice cream
combination: the first value indicates the profit if a slice of pie
type 0 is topped with a scoop of ice cream type 0; the next value
indicates the profit if a slice of pie type 0 is topped with a scoop of
ice cream type 1, and so on. A profit value of `<tt>-1</tt>' indicates
that no combinations of that pie type and ice cream type should ever be
sold. All other integers (number of slices for each type of pie and
number of scoops for each type of ice cream) will be less than or equal
to 100 and the profit on each one of the pie/ice cream combinations
(other than `<tt>-1</tt>') will be larger than 0 and less than or equal to 10, with at most two digits after the decimal point. 

</p><p>
The last problem instance is followed by a line containing two zeroes.

</h2>

<p>
For each problem instance, output the problem number (starting at 1)
followed by the minimum and maximum profits, using the format shown in
the sample output. Display all numbers with two fractional digits. All
problem instances are guaranteed to have at least one solution using
all of the pie slices and ice cream scoops.
