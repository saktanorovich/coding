You have been struck with inspiration, and are designing a beautiful
new art sculpture for the foyer of your local museum. For highly
important artistic reasons, you are designing it using very specific
materials. However, you are not sure if physics is on your side. Will
your sculpture actually stand up? </p><p>
The sculpture will be composed of various ball joints weighing 1
kilogram each, and various rods (of negligible weight) connecting the
joints. Rods cannot be stretched or compressed, and they can never
detach from a joint. However, they are free to rotate around the joints
in any direction. The joints that lie on the ground are glued in place;
all others are free to move. For simplicity, you may ignore the effects
of intersections of rods; each rod exerts force only on the 2 joints
connected to it. Also, any joint that is in the air will have at least
one rod coming out that is not parallel to the ground. This prevents
the degenerate case where a ball is supported only horizontally by a
rigid structure. In real life, it would sag just a little. </p><p>
Write a program to determine whether your structure is static (that is,
will not immediately move from the effects of gravity). Note that each
rod can transmit an arbitrarily large tensional force along its length,
and that ``being static" means that the tensional forces at each joint
balance the weight of the joint. </p><p>
If the structure is static, you must also determine whether it is
stable (that is, will not move if perturbed slightly by pulling its
joints).

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The input contains several sculpture descriptions. Every description begins with a line containing integers <span class="MATH"><i>J</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>R</i></span>, the number of joints and rods in the structure, respectively. Joints are numbered from 1 to <span class="MATH"><i>J</i></span>. The description continues with <span class="MATH"><i>J</i></span> lines, one per joint, each containing 3 floating point numbers giving the <span class="MATH"><i>x</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>y</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>z</i></span> coordinates of that joint. Following are <span class="MATH"><i>R</i></span> lines, one per rod, with 2 distinct integers indicating the joints connected by that rod. 

</p><p>
Each rod is exactly the right length to connect its joints. The <span class="MATH"><i>z</i></span> coordinates will always be non-negative; a <span class="MATH"><i>z</i></span> coordinate of 0 indicates that the joint is on the ground and fixed in place. There are at most 100 joints and 100 rods. 

</p><p>
The last description is followed by a line containing two zeroes.
