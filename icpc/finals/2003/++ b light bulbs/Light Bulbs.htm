Hollywood's newest theater, the Atheneum of Culture and Movies, has a huge
computer-operated marquee
composed of thousands of light bulbs. Each row of bulbs is operated by a set
of switches that are electronically
controlled by a computer program. Unfortunately, the electrician installed
the wrong kind of switches, and tonight is
the ACM's opening night. You must write a program to make the switches perform correctly.

</p><p>
A row of the marquee contains <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> light bulbs controlled by <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> switches.
Bulbs and switches are numbered from 1 to <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>,
left to right. Each bulb can either be ON or OFF. Each input case will contain
the initial state and the desired final
state for a single row of bulbs.

</p><p>
The original lighting plan was to have each switch control a single bulb.
However the electrician's error caused each
switch to control two or three consecutive bulbs, as shown in Figure 1.
The leftmost switch (<span class="MATH"><i>i</i> = 1</span>) toggles the states
of the two leftmost bulbs (1 and 2); the rightmost switch (<span class="MATH"><i>i</i> = <i>n</i></span>) toggles the
states of the two rightmost bulbs
(<span class="MATH"><i>n</i>­1</span> and <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>). Each remaining switch (<span class="MATH">1 &lt; <i>i</i> &lt; <i>n</i></span>) toggles the states of the
three bulbs with indices <span class="MATH"><i>i</i>­1</span>, <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>, and <span class="MATH"><i>i</i> + 1</span>.
(In the special case where there is a single bulb and a single switch, the
switch simply toggles the state of that bulb.)
Thus, if bulb 1 is ON and bulb 2 is OFF, flipping switch 1 will turn
bulb 1 OFF and bulb 2 ON. The minimum cost
of changing a row of bulbs from an initial configuration to a final
configuration is the minimum number of switches
that must be flipped to achieve the change.

You can represent the state of a row of bulbs in binary, where 0 means the
bulb is OFF and 1 means the bulb is ON.
For instance, 01100 represents a row of five bulbs in which the second
and third bulbs are both ON. You could
transform this state into 10000 by flipping switches 1, 4, and 5, but it would
be less costly to simply flip switch 2.

</p><p>
You must write a program that determines the switches that must be flipped to
change a row of light bulbs from its
initial state to its desired final state with minimal cost. Some combinations
of initial and final states may not be
feasible. For compactness of representation, decimal integers are used instead of
binary for the bulb configurations.
Thus, 01100 and 10000 are represented by the decimal integers 12 and 16.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input file contains several test cases. Each test case consists of one line.
The line contains two non-negative
decimal integers, at least one of which is positive and each of which contains
at most 100 digits. The first integer
represents the initial state of the row of bulbs and the second integer
represents the final state of the row. The binary
equivalent of these integers represents the initial and final states of the bulbs,
where 1 means ON and 0 means OFF.

<p>
To avoid problems with leading zeros, assume that the first bulb in either
the initial or the final configuration (or
both) is ON. There are no leading or trailing blanks in the input lines,
no leading zeros in the two decimal integers,
and the initial and final states are separated by a single blank.

</p><p>
The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each test case, print a line containing the case number and a decimal
integer representing a minimum-cost set of
switches that need to be flipped to convert the row of bulbs from initial
state to final state. In the binary equivalent
of this integer, the rightmost (least significant) bit represents the
<span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>-th switch, 1 indicates that a switch has been
flipped, and 0 indicates that the switch has not been flipped.
If there is no solution, print `<tt>impossible</tt>'. If there is
more than one solution, print the one with the smallest decimal equivalent.

<p>
Print a blank line between cases. Use the output format shown in the example.
