<P>Professor B. Heif is conducting experiments with a species of South American 
bees that he found during an expedition to the Brazilian rain forest. The honey 
produced by these bees is of superior quality compared to the honey from 
European and North American honey bees. Unfortunately, the bees do not breed 
well in captivity. Professor Heif thinks the reason is that the placement of the 
different maggots (for workers, queens, etc.) within the honeycomb depends on 
environmental conditions, which are different in his laboratory and the rain 
forest. 
<P>
<P><BR>As a first step to validate his theory, Professor Heif wants to quantify 
the difference in maggot placement. For this he measures the distance between 
the cells of the comb into which the maggots are placed. To this end, the 
professor has labeled the cells by marking an arbitrary cell as number 1, and 
then labeling the remaining cells in a clockwise fashion, as shown in the 
following figure.

<P>For example, two maggots in cells 19 and 30 are 5 cells apart. One of the 
shortest paths connecting the two cells is via the cells 19 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 15 - 
30, so you must move five times to adjacent cells to get from 19 to 30. 
<P>
<P><BR>Professor Heif needs your help to write a program that computes the 
distance, defined as the number of cells in a shortest path, between any pair of 
cells.
